---

## Phase 1: Setup & Infrastructure

> **Goal**: Establish the ADK project scaffold, Google Gen AI SDK wiring, and Agents API provisioning so every subsequent phase has a runnable foundation.

- [x] T001 Create `services/agent/` directory and initialize as ADK app package — `services/agent/__init__.py` (empty), `services/agent/requirements.txt` (`google-adk>=2.0.0`, `google-genai`, `google-cloud-bigquery`, `vertexai`), `services/agent/.env.example` (`GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=spatial-cat-489006-a4`, `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=global`, `GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_ENTERPRISE=true`)
- [x] T002 [P] Initialize Gen AI SDK client using ADC + enterprise mode per gemini-api skill — `services/agent/client.py` (`from google import genai; client = genai.Client()` with `GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_ENTERPRISE=true`; no hard-coded credentials)
- [x] T003 [P] Add `services/agent/` to the existing Docker Compose / dev runner so it starts alongside `serving-api` and `replay` — update `docker-compose.yml` or create `services/agent/Dockerfile`
- [x] T004 Provision the `ro_assistant` Agent resource on Agent Platform via Agents API (gemini-agents-api skill) — `services/agent/provision.sh`: POST to `https://aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1beta1/projects/${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}/locations/global/agents`, agent id `ro-assistant`, base_agent `antigravity-preview-05-2026`, system_instruction as the governance preamble; poll LRO until `"done": true`; print agent resource name
- [x] T005 Create `services/agent/.specify/feature.json` and branch config pointing to `007-ai-assistant`

---

## Phase 2: Foundation — Tools, Governance Callback, Core Entities

> **Goal**: All shared tools and the anti-hallucination governance callback exist and are unit-tested before any agent uses them. These are hard prerequisites for every user story phase.

- [x] T006 [P] Define `services/agent/tools.py` — `query_bigquery(sql: str) → dict` (BigQuery MCP server wrapper; returns `{rows, schema, capability}`); `detect_anomaly(unit_id, signal, date_range) → dict` (wraps `AI.DETECT_ANOMALIES`); `simulate_watertap(unit_id, params) → dict` (POST to WaterTAP Cloud Run); `search_docs(query: str) → list[dict]` (`VECTOR_SEARCH` on `ro_embeddings.doc_embeddings`); `run_calculation(code: str) → dict` (Code Execution sandbox)
- [x] T007 Define `record_decision` tool in `services/agent/tools.py` — HITL-gated: accepts `proposal_id` + `payload`; ONLY executes BigQuery INSERT to `ro_serving.decision_log` after `status == "approved"` is set by the approval chip event; raises `GovernanceError` if called without approval
- [x] T008 [P] Define typed `CapabilityResult`, `Evidence` union types, `GroundedAnswer`, `SourceTrace`, `RecordWritingProposal`, `MemoryBankFact` dataclasses in `services/agent/models.py` — matches `data-model.md` exactly
- [x] T009 Implement `after_model` governance callback in `services/agent/callbacks.py` — scans every LLM output for numeric tokens not traceable to a tool result in the current session; raises/flags any bare number; also detects `RecordWritingProposal` JSON and sets `status = "pending"` before surfacing to the frontend
- [x] T010 [P] Implement prompt-injection resistance middleware in `services/agent/callbacks.py` — `before_tool` callback: sanitize `unit_id` (allowlist `[A-G]-0[1-3]`), reject tool calls triggered by content from untrusted uploaded docs that attempt to bypass governance gates (FR-018)
- [x] T011 [P] Create SKILL.md files for all 6 domain skills in `services/agent/skills/`: `fouling-diagnosis/SKILL.md`, `clean-now-or-wait/SKILL.md`, `delta-economics/SKILL.md`, `recovery-optimization/SKILL.md`, `antiscalant-dosing/SKILL.md`, `compliance-check/SKILL.md` — each: name, description, instructions referencing the evidence contract it must honour
- [x] T012 [P] Write pytest foundation tests in `services/source-tracing/tests/test_assistant.py` — NaN-safety (no bare "nan"), no-bare-number guard (each figure maps to a known capability CSV column), honest non-answer for missing unit

---

## Phase 3: US1 — Grounded Q&A (Single-Capability Routing)

> **Goal**: Operator asks a plain-language question → assistant routes to the correct single capability → returns a grounded, traceable answer. Every figure sourced.

- [x] T013 [US1] Implement `DataAnalyst` sub-agent in `services/agent/agent.py` — `mode="task"`, model `gemini-3.5-flash`, tools: `[query_bigquery, detect_anomaly]`, skills: `[fouling-diagnosis]`; system instruction enforces FR-006 (no bare numbers) and FR-009 (source-trace every figure)
- [x] T014 [US1] Implement `Document` sub-agent in `services/agent/agent.py` — `mode="task"`, model `gemini-3.5-flash`, tools: `[search_docs]`, skills: `[compliance-check]`; returns `CapabilityResult` with `DeviationEvidence` or `ValidationEvidence`
- [x] T015 [US1] Implement `Coordinator` root agent in `services/agent/agent.py` — `mode="chat"` (default), model `gemini-3.5-flash`, `sub_agents=[data_analyst, document, ...]`; system instruction: advise-only preamble, no actuation, route to sub-agents via `request_task_*`; `App` with `ContextCacheConfig(min_tokens=2048, ttl_seconds=600, cache_intervals=5)`
- [x] T016 [US1] Add Next.js API route `services/frontend/app/api/agent/stream/route.ts` — POST body → Agent Runtime session message using `google-genai` client; returns SSE stream via `ReadableStream`; sets agent resource path `projects/spatial-cat-489006-a4/locations/global/agents/ro-assistant`
- [x] T017 [US1] Add `services/frontend/lib/api/agent.ts` — `startAgentSession()`, `sendMessage(sessionId, text)`, `streamResponse(sessionId)` wrapping the `/api/agent/stream` route
- [x] T018 [US1] Create Zustand `assistant-store.ts` in `services/frontend/lib/store/assistant-store.ts` — `isOpen`, `sessionId`, `messages: Message[]`, `toggle()`, `open()`, `close()`, `addMessage()`, `setSessionId()`; Message type: `{id, role, content, sourcedFigures?, proposal?}`
- [x] T019 [US1] Create `AssistantTrigger` floating button component in `services/frontend/components/assistant/assistant-trigger.tsx` — fixed position bottom-right, visible on all routes; toggles `assistant-store.isOpen`; uses existing design tokens from `DESIGN.md`; **note: full premium styling deferred to `/impeccable` phase**
- [x] T020 [US1] Create base `AssistantPanel` slide-in component in `services/frontend/components/assistant/assistant-panel.tsx` — `@a2ui/react` `<A2UISurface>` + `useA2UI()` hook; streams from `streamResponse()`; renders `Message[]` from `assistant-store`; basic layout and typography only (**impeccable pass later**)
- [x] T021 [US1] Mount `AssistantPanel` and `AssistantTrigger` globally in `services/frontend/app/layout.tsx`
- [x] T022 [US1] Manual smoke test per quickstart.md Scenario 1 + Scenario 4: assistant opens, question answered, every figure shows source tag — document result in `quickstart.md`

---

## Phase 4: US2 — Multi-Capability Orchestration

> **Goal**: Coordinator routes cross-boundary questions (clean-now-vs-wait, earliest-trusted-signal) to multiple sub-agents and composes a single coherent answer.

- [x] T023 [US2] Implement `Simulation` sub-agent in `services/agent/agent.py` — `mode="task"`, model `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` (complex reasoning), tools: `[simulate_watertap, query_bigquery]`, skills: `[clean-now-or-wait]`; returns `CapabilityResult` with `ForecastEvidence`
- [x] T024 [US2] Implement `Economics` sub-agent in `services/agent/agent.py` — `mode="task"`, model `gemini-3.5-flash`, tools: `[query_bigquery, run_calculation]`, skills: `[delta-economics, recovery-optimization, antiscalant-dosing]`; returns `CapabilityResult` with `EconomicsEvidence`; always leads with delta, labels measured vs modeled
- [x] T025 [US2] Add coordinator routing logic for multi-capability questions — `services/agent/agent.py`: coordinator system instruction teaches routing heuristics (energy question → DataAnalyst; clean-now-vs-wait → Simulation + Economics + DataAnalyst; trust question → DataAnalyst + Document); fan-out via parallel `request_task_*`
- [x] T026 [US2] Implement capability-disagreement surface — `services/agent/callbacks.py`: `after_model` detects conflicting signals in composed `CapabilityResult` list (e.g. forecast says wait, economics says clean); injects tension block with each side's evidence into the answer (FR-016)
- [x] T027 [US2] Add `SourceTrace` rendering in `AssistantPanel` — `services/frontend/components/assistant/source-trace-badge.tsx`: small inline badge per figure showing `[capability] [measured|modeled]`; consumed from `message.sourcedFigures`
- [x] T028 [US2] Manual smoke test per quickstart.md Scenario 2 (multi-capability clean-now-vs-wait) — document result

---

## Phase 5: US3 — Evidence Presentation

> **Goal**: Every quantitative figure carries its type-specific evidence in the UI. Zero bare numbers surface.

- [x] T029 [P] [US3] Implement `EvidenceCard` component in `services/frontend/components/assistant/evidence-card.tsx` — renders per `Evidence` type: `ForecastEvidence` (CI range + drivers list), `AnomalyEvidence` (deviating signal + magnitude), `FoulingEvidence` (attribution bar), `EconomicsEvidence` (measured/modeled badge + assumptions list), `DeviationEvidence` (baseline vs actual delta)
- [x] T030 [P] [US3] Wire `EvidenceCard` into `AssistantPanel` message renderer — collapsed by default, expandable; attach to every figure in `message.sourcedFigures`
- [x] T031 [P] [US3] Add credibility metadata display in `EvidenceCard` — validation basis badge (`plant-data` / `bench` / `literature` / `vendor` / `assumed`) + decision-grade chip for economics figures (FR-021)
- [x] T032 [US3] Validate SC-003 (100% evidence coverage) — `services/source-tracing/tests/test_assistant.py`: assert each surfaced figure in briefing has non-null evidence; assert zero bare numbers in `data/briefings.txt`
- [x] T033 [US3] Manual smoke test per quickstart.md Scenario 3 — inspect forecast, anomaly, fouling, and cost figures in chat; confirm each carries its evidence — document result

---

## Phase 6: US4 — Honest Non-Answers (No Hallucination Gate)

> **Goal**: Missing data, unsupported range, unvalidated accuracy → assistant says "I don't know / not yet validated". Zero fabrications.

- [x] T034 [US4] Implement honest non-answer path in coordinator system instruction — `services/agent/agent.py`: if all sub-agents return empty/null `CapabilityResult`, coordinator MUST return `is_honest_non_answer=true` with explicit "I don't know / not yet validated" — never synthesize a plausible number (FR-010/FR-011/FR-012)
- [x] T035 [US4] Implement range-limit flag in DataAnalyst and Simulation sub-agents — if question horizon > max supported by trajectory, return `CapabilityResult(value=None, range_exceeded=True)` with explanation string; coordinator surfaces the limit explicitly
- [x] T036 [P] [US4] Render honest-non-answer state in `AssistantPanel` — `services/frontend/components/assistant/assistant-panel.tsx`: grey "I don't know" bubble with explanation text and optional "Ask a different question" suggestion chip
- [x] T037 [US4] Run quickstart.md Scenario 5 (honest non-answer check) — document result; add to `test_assistant.py`

---

## Phase 7: US5 — Governance Gates (HITL + No-Actuation)

> **Goal**: Advise-only and HITL approval chip are hard enforcement, not soft guidelines. All governance gates verified green.

- [x] T038 [US5] Implement `HitlChip` component in `services/frontend/components/assistant/hitl-chip.tsx` — a2ui `Button` pair (Approve primary / Dismiss secondary) rendered inline at the bottom of proposal message bubble; Approve fires POST to `/api/agent/approve`; Dismiss fires POST to `/api/agent/dismiss`; both disable both buttons after action
- [x] T039 [US5] Add `services/frontend/app/api/agent/approve/route.ts` and `services/frontend/app/api/agent/dismiss/route.ts` — approve: updates `proposal.status = "approved"` in assistant-store then calls `record_decision` tool via Agent Runtime; dismiss: sets `status = "dismissed"`, no write
- [x] T040 [US5] Wire `HitlChip` into `AssistantPanel` — detect `message.proposal` in message render loop; when present, render `HitlChip` at bottom of that message bubble
- [x] T041 [US5] Add actuation-refusal instruction to coordinator — `services/agent/agent.py`: coordinator system instruction includes explicit NO-ACT clause; `before_tool` callback in `callbacks.py` checks every tool call against an actuation denylist (`SET_FLOW`, `ADJUST_PRESSURE`, `DOSE_CHEMICAL`, `STOP_PUMP`, `OPEN_VALVE`, `CLOSE_VALVE`) and raises `ActuationBlockedError` (FR-013)
- [x] T042 [US5] Add prompt-injection adversarial tests to `services/source-tracing/tests/test_assistant.py` — test inputs designed to induce fabrication, actuation, ungated write; confirm all three blockers hold (SC-009)
- [x] T043 [US5] Manual smoke test per quickstart.md Scenario 2 HITL path — attempt write, confirm approval chip appears, approve, confirm BigQuery write; attempt dismiss, confirm no write — document result

---

## Phase 8: US6 — Memory Bank & Context Persistence

> **Goal**: Cross-session facts (cost overrides, plant facts, operator preferences) persist in Memory Bank. Session transcript lives only in-flight.

- [x] T044 [US6] Create `ro_serving.agent_memory` BigQuery table via `infra/bigquery.tf` or SQL migration — schema matches `MemoryBankFact` data model: `fact_type`, `key`, `value` (JSON), `unit_id`, `written_at`, `written_by`
- [x] T045 [US6] Implement Memory Bank write tool `save_memory_fact` in `services/agent/tools.py` — HITL-gated (same approval pattern as `record_decision`); writes to `ro_serving.agent_memory`; called by coordinator when operator confirms a cost override or plant fact
- [x] T046 [US6] Implement Memory Bank read in coordinator startup — `services/agent/agent.py`: on new session, `query_bigquery` to load relevant `MemoryBankFact` rows scoped to the current session's unit context; inject into coordinator context prefix
- [x] T047 [US6] Implement conversational cost override relay — coordinator detects cost-override intent (e.g. "assume power costs $0.14/kWh"); stores override in session state; passes it to Economics sub-agent for the rest of the session; on approval, persists via `save_memory_fact`

---

## Phase 9: US7 — Latency & Semantic Cache (SC-010/SC-011)

> **Goal**: < 5 s P95 simple Q&A, < 15 s P95 multi-capability, < 1 s P95 cache hit. All verified via Cloud Trace.

- [x] T048 [US7] Implement semantic cache table `ro_embeddings.qa_cache` — schema: `question_embedding ARRAY<FLOAT64>`, `question_text STRING`, `answer_json JSON`, `cached_at TIMESTAMP`, `is_time_sensitive BOOL`; index on embedding column
- [x] T049 [US7] Add semantic cache middleware to `/api/agent/stream` route — `services/frontend/app/api/agent/stream/route.ts`: before forwarding to Agent Runtime, embed question via `AI.GENERATE_EMBEDDING`; run `VECTOR_SEARCH` on `qa_cache`; if `cosine_sim > 0.92` AND `!is_time_sensitive`, return cached answer SSE stream immediately (< 1 s gate)
- [x] T050 [US7] Add cache write-back after agent response — on successful GroundedAnswer, classify `is_time_sensitive` (contains "now", "current", "today", "this cycle" → true); if `!is_time_sensitive`, insert into `qa_cache`
- [x] T051 [US7] Run latency measurements via `adk eval` + Cloud Trace — `specs/007-ai-assistant/eval/latency_check.sh`; assert P95 < 5 s single-cap, < 15 s multi-cap; document in `quickstart.md` Scenario 6

---

## Phase 10: US8 — Frontend Three-Panel Layout (`/twin`)

> **Goal**: On `/twin`, plant-scene shrinks proportionally (stays visible and interactive) when assistant opens. Inspector and assistant coexist.

- [x] T052 [US8] Update `/twin` page wrapper to CSS grid three-panel layout — `services/frontend/app/twin/page.tsx`: `display: grid`, `grid-template-columns: 1fr 320px 0px` (default), animated to `1fr 320px 360px` when `assistant-store.isOpen`; CSS transition `grid-template-columns 0.3s ease`
- [x] T053 [US8] Ensure plant-scene component scales down but remains interactive — `services/frontend/components/plant-scene.tsx` (or equivalent): add `min-width: 320px` floor; plant SVG/canvas resizes via `viewBox` / `ResizeObserver`; no hidden overflow or pointer-events: none when assistant is open
- [x] T054 [US8] Verify panel accessibility from all routes — add `AssistantTrigger` render test: assert it renders in `layout.tsx` across `/`, `/twin`, `/economics`, `/simulation` routes; confirm `assistant-store` state is shared

---

## Phase 11: US9 — ADK Deploy & Eval

> **Goal**: Agent deployed to Agent Runtime via `agents-cli`; `adk eval` golden Q&A set passes; Cloud Trace verified.

- [x] T055 [US9] Create `specs/007-ai-assistant/eval/golden_qa.json` — ≥50 Q&A pairs covering: single-capability grounding, multi-capability composition, honest non-answers, evidence attachment, HITL proposal, adversarial injection attempts; format per `adk eval` schema
- [x] T056 [US9] Deploy agent to Agent Runtime — `services/agent/deploy.sh`: `uv run adk deploy agent_engine --project=spatial-cat-489006-a4 --region=us-central1 --staging_bucket=gs://spatial-cat-489006-a4-agent-staging --display_name="RO Diagnostic Assistant" ./services/agent`; verify LRO completes
- [x] T057 [US9] Run `adk eval services/agent/ --eval_set specs/007-ai-assistant/eval/golden_qa.json` — target: ≥90% answer quality score on grounded-answer rubric; 100% governance gate score; document results in `quickstart.md`
- [x] T058 [US9] Verify Cloud Trace latency SLOs — run 20 single-cap + 20 multi-cap + 10 cache-hit queries; export trace spans; assert P95 meets SC-010/SC-011; document in `quickstart.md` Scenario 6

---

## Phase 12: Polish & Cross-Cutting — `/impeccable` Frontend Pass

> **Goal**: AI assistant panel elevated to premium, production-grade UI. Apply `/impeccable` design skill to all assistant components.

- [x] T059 [US8] Apply `/impeccable` design pass to `AssistantPanel` (`services/frontend/components/assistant/assistant-panel.tsx`) — streaming token animation, premium chat bubble typography, glassmorphism panel background consistent with `DESIGN.md` dark palette.
- [x] T060 [US8] Apply `/impeccable` design pass to `AssistantTrigger` (`services/frontend/components/assistant/assistant-trigger.tsx`) — animated pulse / glow idle state, smooth slide-in/out transitions, accessible focus ring.
- [x] T061 [US8] Apply `/impeccable` design pass to `EvidenceCard` (`services/frontend/components/assistant/evidence-card.tsx`) — accordion expand with spring animation, color-coded by evidence type, readable at reduced panel width.
- [x] T062 [US8] Apply `/impeccable` design pass to `AssistantProposalCard` (`services/frontend/components/assistant/assistant-proposal-card.tsx`) — clear visual distinction Approve (emerald) / Dismiss (muted), disabled loading state after tap, success confirmation micro-animation.
- [x] T063 [US8] Apply `/impeccable` design pass to `SourceTraceBadge` (`services/frontend/components/assistant/source-trace-badge.tsx`) — subtle pill with capability icon, measured/modeled color coding.
- [x] T064 [US8] Responsive check — confirm three-panel layout is usable at 1280 px viewport width; plant-scene floor `min-width: 320px` respected; assistant panel scrolls independently
- [x] T065 [US8] Accessibility pass — keyboard focus trap in assistant panel, ARIA labels on all interactive elements, Escape closes panel

---

## Phase 13: Tests & Documentation

- [x] T067 [P] Add TypeScript `zod` schema validation for `Message`, `CapabilityResult`, `RecordWritingProposal` in `services/frontend/lib/types/assistant.ts` — runtime validation at SSE parse boundary
- [x] T068 Update `specs/007-ai-assistant/tasks.md` — mark all completed tasks `[x]`
- [x] T069 Update `walkthrough.md` with Feature 007 summary — architecture decisions, agent topology diagram, frontend layout, eval results

---

## Dependencies

```
Phase 1 (Setup) → Phase 2 (Foundation)
Phase 2 → Phase 3 (US1), Phase 4 (US2), Phase 5 (US3), Phase 6 (US4), Phase 7 (US5)
Phase 3 (US1 agent + frontend wired) → Phase 4 (US2 adds Simulation + Economics)

- ADK agent running locally with `adk run`, governance gates enforced, all US1–US5 acceptance scenarios passing, basic chat panel in frontend (no premium styling yet).

**Increment 2** (Phases 8–9, T044–T058):
- Memory Bank, semantic cache, latency SLOs verified, full eval set passing.

**Increment 3** (Phases 10–13, T059–T069):
- `/impeccable` premium frontend, three-panel layout, full test coverage, deployed and documented.

## Key Model / SDK Notes (from gemini-api + gemini-agents-api skills)

- **SDK**: `google-genai` only — `from google import genai; client = genai.Client()` + `GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_ENTERPRISE=true`. Do NOT use legacy `google-cloud-aiplatform` or `google-generativeai`.
- **Models**: `gemini-3.5-flash` (default, coordinator + DataAnalyst + Economics + Document), `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` (Simulation sub-agent only — complex multi-step reasoning).
- **Agent Runtime LOCATION**: `global` (prevents 404). If 404 occurs, check `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=global` — it is almost never the model name.
- **Agents API**: Control Plane endpoint `https://aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1beta1/projects/${PROJECT}/locations/global/agents`. Agent creation is an LRO — poll until `"done": true`.
- **update_mask required**: Any PATCH to the agent resource must include `?update_mask=<field>` to avoid overwriting other config.
- **Interactions API**: Use `gemini-interactions-api` skill for Data Plane conversation execution (multi-turn, streaming, HITL) — see `../gemini-interactions-api/SKILL.md`.
